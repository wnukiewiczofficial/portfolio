          Internship at Pro-Comp Computer Store{" "}

        <p className="text-sm md:text-base lg:text-xl">
          During my internship at a computer store, I was involved in various
          aspects beyond sales of computer equipment. I was responsible for
          repairing damaged and faulty computers for customers, as well as
          optimizing devices used by other employees within the store. In
          addition to my work at the physical store, I participated in special
          projects for a company. This involved tasks such as installing
          printers, configuring networks, repairing devices, and setting up
          workstations in various businesses and schools. I also handled the
          repair and assembly of interactive whiteboards at a school.
          Furthermore, I created a website for a local kindergarten as a
          commissioned project for the company where I was interning. I
          developed it from scratch using PHP, incorporating a user-friendly
          content management system (CMS) and an administration panel. This
          allowed for easy content updates, user management, and customization
          of simple elements on the website. The entire website was programmed
          from the ground up.
