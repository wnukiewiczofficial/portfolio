        Currently, I am a student at Pozna≈Ñ University of Technology, pursuing a
        degree in Computer Science. I am in my second semester and have a keen
        interest in coding and developing new websites, applications, and games.
        In my spare time, I love to immerse myself in programming and have
        several projects posted on my Github profile. Additionally, I work as a
        freelance developer and have garnered valuable experience in the
        commercial creation of web-based games. My ultimate goal is to
        specialize in full-stack web development and create seamless and dynamic
        web applications.
